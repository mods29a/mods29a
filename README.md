- 👋 Hi, I’m Z-AbouShady (call me that 😉)
- 👀 I’m interested in Visual Basic 6, Assembly x86, and C#
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Hacking with Kali
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Kali
- 📫 How to reach me: e-mail: zaboushady@gmail.com


I'm an ambitious person and geeky towards Reverse Engineering, Hacking, and Writing code that does "strange" things in
programming languages (like VBB6) that does not officially support that particular "strange thing".

LOL!

I know I may sound a little cryptic and "not understandable," but this is how I like it 😎


I've just started, so please be patient about my codes.


My first published post is about calculating CRC32 of data in VB6 with ASSEMBLY code... Hmmmm.. ASM + VB6 = SUPER!

* Second project: AES (AES Rijndael Block Cipher) Class written completely in VB6 with no dependencies.
* See 'cAES.cls' file.


I'll try to be active. However, I have too much day-to-day obligations. So, I *might* be kinda slow, if you know what I mean.



Thank you!😋
